Songyang Zhang
=====
I am currently a graduate student in 
[Energy Conversion System Research Group](http://machinececs.seee.hust.edu.cn/ABOUT/Research_Group.htm)
at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) and my tutor is
[Wei Xu](http://machinececs.seee.hust.edu.cn/info/1037/1397.htm)
. Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am looking for a Phd position abraod for further stduy. And my research interests include Power Electronics, Design of Digital Control System and  Power Conversion Systems.

I joined 
[Sci&Tech innovation centre (STI)](http://sti.hust.edu.cn/)
in 2014 to practice and won the 3rd prize in the National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in 2015 when I was an undergraduate student. Whatâ€™s more, I also finished a High-current and voltage fault simulation system controller, as a key member, and Electric Intelligent Warning System, as a captain. When I entered my graduate study, I learn knowledge about Brushless doubly-fed machine and assisted advanced graduate students in doing their experiments, settlement of hardware circuit errors and programming. Compared with motor design and control, power electronics is more attractive to me. So I pay more attention to hardware skills during the study because I think it would be more helpful for my doctoral study in the future. For now I design a Back-to-back converter with EtherCAT independently and join a project about the design of the driving system of a driverless car.

In particular, you can get more details and pictures about those project through different tabs, which refers to the different experience.
