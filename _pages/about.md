Songyang Zhang
=====
I am currently a graduate student in 
[Energy Conversion System Research Group](http://machinececs.seee.hust.edu.cn/ABOUT/Research_Group.htm)
at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) and my tutor is
[Wei Xu](http://machinececs.seee.hust.edu.cn/info/1037/1397.htm)
. Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am looking for a Phd position abroad for further stduy. And my research interests include Power Electronics, Design of Digital Control System and  Power Conversion Systems.

I joined 
[Sci&Tech innovation centre (STI)](http://sti.hust.edu.cn/)
in 2014 to learn more about electrical engineering and won the 3rd prize in the National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in 2015 when I was an undergraduate student. Whatâ€™s more, I also completed the missions of a High-current and voltage fault simulation system controller and Electric Intelligent Warning System, as a captain in the process. When I entered my graduate study, I acquired knowledge about Brushless doubly-fed machine and assisted advanced graduate students in their experiments, settlement of hardware circuit errors and programming. However, compared with motor design and control, power electronics is more attractive to me. So I pay much more attention to hardware design because it would be helpful for my doctoral study in the future from my perspective. And now I am designing a Back-to-back converter with EtherCAT independently and also take part in a project about the design of the Driving System of a Driverless Car. 


In particular, you can get more details and pictures about those project through different tabs, which refers to the different experience.
