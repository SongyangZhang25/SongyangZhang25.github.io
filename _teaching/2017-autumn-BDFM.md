Brushless doubly fed machine （BDFM）is the research subject of my research group. Therefore in the experiments, I learned the model of brushless doubly fed machine, and ran simulations and experiments of its connection with nonlinear loads. My responsibilities include assistance to senior students with their experiments，settlemrnt of hardware circuit errors in lexperiment platform，and programming of part of the DSP controller.

In the lab my platform circuit work contains production of voltage and current sampling circuit board. Software work include DSP controller CAN communication programming. Experimental work focuses on shifting nonlinear load，variable load，and speed sensorless.
Besides I built the Mtalab model for the direct power control of BDFM, and also used the DDSRF and MSOGI methods for harmonic analysis simulation under nonlinear load conditions.
