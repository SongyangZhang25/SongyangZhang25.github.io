In February 2016, together with two other classmates, I participated in the American Mathematical Modeling Competition. One classmate was responsible for writing reports and assisting. The other one focued on the calculation of load programming and problem solving. I mainly worked on mathematical modeling, choosing the right solution to complete the model design.

During the 3-day contest, my word was collecting date of water use in agricultural, industrial, and other aspects from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, choosing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method to complete the water resources analysis in North China area. The method is establishing a scoring model, calculating and analyzing the data. It scored the regional water resources and compared the severity of the water shortage in different area by giving different weights to each factor.

Finally we won the Honorable Mention in Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling

Problem Statement
The International Clean water Movement (ICM) wants your team to help them solve the world’s
water problems. Can you help improve access to clean, fresh water?

Task 1: Develop a model that provides a measure of the ability of a region to provide clean water
to meet the needs of its population. You may need to consider the dynamic nature of the factors
that affect both supply and demand in your modeling process.

Task 2: Using the UN water scarcity map (http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/jpg/0222-
waterstress-overuse-EN.jpg) pick one country or region where water is either heavily or
moderately overloaded. Explain why and how water is scarce in that region. Make sure to
explain both the social and environmental drivers by addressing physical and/or economic
scarcity.

Task 3: In your chosen region from Task 2, use your model from Task 1 to show what the water situation will be in 15 years. How does this situation impact the lives of citizens of this region?
Be sure to incorporate the environmental drivers’ effects on the model components.

Task 4: For your chosen region, design an intervention plan taking all the drivers of water
scarcity into account. Any intervention plan will inevitably impact the surrounding areas, as well



In task 1, we use the Logarithmic Mean Divisible Index (LMDI) to develop the Factor
Decomposition Model for the changing consumption of industrial water. We also use a Linear
Regression Model to explore the time-related agricultural water consumption. Taking differentdynamic factors into consideration, we finally build a Fuzzy Evaluation Model using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
method to measure the ability of a region to provide clean water to meet the needs of its	
population.

In task 2, we choose North China as the object of our study. Using the fuzzy evaluation
model, we conclude that water is heavily overloaded in North China.

In task 3, we establish a linear regression model to predict the trend of water consumption
of North China in 3 different aspects: the change of industrial water, agricultural water and
domestic water. We find that the industrial water and the agriculture water is decreasing while
the domestic water is increasing in 15 years.

In task 4 and task 5, we design an intervention plan taking all the drivers of water scarcity
into account. After that, we analyze the impact of our intervention. Some measures to ease the water scarcity in North China are put forward.
